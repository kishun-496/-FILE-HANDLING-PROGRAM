DOMAIN: C Programming

BATCH DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR NAME: NEELA SANTHOSH

TASK DESCRIPTION:

To perform file operations in C — including creating, writing to, reading from, and appending data — you begin by including the stdio.h library and declaring a FILE *fp pointer for file management. Use fopen() with "w" mode to create or overwrite a file and write data using fprintf() or fputs(). To read from the file, reopen it in "r" mode and use fgets() to capture each line into a buffer, displaying content via printf(). For appending, switch to "a" mode with fopen() and add new data at the end using similar write functions, ensuring no previous content is erased. Always check if the file opens successfully using if (fp == NULL) to handle errors, and use fclose(fp) after each operation to free resources and commit changes. This task builds core understanding of external data manipulation in C and lays the groundwork for more advanced, interactive file-based programs
