BATCH DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR NAME: NEELA SANTHOSH

TASK DESCRIPTION:
To complete the task of creating, reading, writing, and appending to a file in C, you first include the stdio.h header and define a FILE pointer for managing file operations. Use fopen() in "w" mode to create and write initial content to a file, followed by fprintf() to insert text and fclose() to safely close it. Next, reopen the file in "r" mode to read its contents line by line using fgets() within a loop, and print each line with printf(). Then, use "a" mode with fopen() to append new data without erasing existing content, writing with fprintf() or fputs() and closing the file again. Each step should include error handling to ensure the file was successfully opened before proceeding. This foundational task demonstrates effective file control in C and sets the stage for more advanced applications like logging user data or saving game progress.
